					Expense Management is a time-consuming and painful experience. Your mission to make <span className='lead font-weight-bold'>company spending

					in the face of complexity organisations either fail to plan and develop strategies or have really complex processes that hamper growth.
					In stark contrast, I‚Äôm particularly impressed with your lean MVP approach. By openly engaging with customers through your changelog and being
					transparent of your product roadmap and decisions has enabled Pleo to grow fiercely in a short span of time and create an impact.

					Well, <span className='lead font-weight-bold'>I'm selfish!</span> My job as a consultant requires me to travel extensively and I have first-hand

					A chance encounter in this industry spurred into what has now become an all-consuming interest in Fintech.
					Over the last year, I have extensively advocated for and introduced cutting edge technologies and
					process automation within traditional banks and WAM firms to improve customer experiences
					and margins. Rather than consulting from the sidelines, I‚Äôm now hungry to work at the forefront with Pleo
					to build a solution that meets the needs of today‚Äôs modern workforce ‚Äì i.e. reshaping how businesses manage
					spending (i.e. world domination üòé)

				<p>
					Through my stint at EY, I have managed several projects pertaining to strategy, process efficiency and growth
					expansion. Some of the common themes in these engagements have been - identifying pain points,
					communicating &amp; negotating with internal/external stakeholders and developing product roadmaps.
					For e.g. launching a STEM app to 9k school girls across 3 countries, designing and
					launching a pilot Robo-Advisor for a Spanish retail bank to 30k customers, etc. I believe my experience in
					program management will prove to be an asset as I'll be closely working with teams across the firm to drive growth,
					international expansion and plan key focus areas over the next one year.

					I‚Äôve always been motivated by innovation and disrupting markets. I think there is a real

					Be it my leap from Luxury Brand Management to Consulting and now building a spending solution that addresses a pain point faced by every industry.

					As a consultant, I spend a good chunk of my time conducting research interviews with
